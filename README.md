This is a collection of config files I use on OSX 10.8.2.

It includes:
- my VIM setup (plugins are managed with vundle)
- ZSH + oh-my-sh
- an installation script that symlinks the config files and installs various
development tools, including webservers, libraries and gems. I use Homebrew as
package manager.
- some tweaks for OSX

Note: XCode and Command lines tools must be installed before running this
script.
